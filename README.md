# Ride Matching Service Readme

## Tests

A suite of unit tests for the service can be found in `test/java/services/RideMatchingServiceTest` which tests the main requirements of the application.

## Setup and Execution

For the sake of the scope of this exercise, the service can be triggered through the main class, with data stored in memory as per the assignment specification.
In a real production environment additional layers would be implemented, there would be a database for persisting the drivers and rides and a controller layer to
facilitate use of the service from external sources such as through an app or browser.
